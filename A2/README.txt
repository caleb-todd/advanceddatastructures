TASK 5:
The impact of the phase 1 is more or less just reversed, sort of making the high values on the left and low ones on 
the right, but skipping the small trees added some bunches and it's not as clean
In phase 2, its just a sort of flipped order of doing things, but finding the rotations to meet the height
The tradeoff seems that it is faster, but in the end is sort of all piled onto one side, and had some bunching by skipping small trees
You could change it to skip subtrees of 3 or 4, but this could just make it messier or more unbalanced, but could be quicker

Comments:
Made it a bit too difficult for myself, for how easy it really was
